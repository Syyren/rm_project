# Ryan M Developer Website

Hello and welcome to the repository for my website.
The central goal of this site is to showcase my project work, providing my code with a "central" home.

## Purpose

The reason I decided to create this site is there is currently no easy and clean way to access what I've written, especially with how cluttered GitHub can get.
